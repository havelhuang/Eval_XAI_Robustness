# Eval_XAI_Robustness
This is the repository for paper ["SAFARI: Versatile and Efficient Evaluations for Robustness of Interpretability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09418). It proposes two evaluation metrics for robustness of interpretation from worst-case and probabilistic perspective, resepectively. The popular XAI methods, such as Integreted Gradient, LRP, and DeepLift are supported for the evaluation.
